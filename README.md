A tiny Files sharing platform, for my Photo customers

Live version : 

http://charlespattyn.be/php_15/index.php

+ *Admin account : admin / admin_pwd*
+ *Verified user : linky / linky_pwd*
+ *Unverified user : user / user*

### Content

What is fully working :

1. Secure Login
2. Inscription Form (Will need Admin status upgraded to acces private content)
3. Auto acces to a private section when logged and Account upgraded by a Admin (Status)
4. Responsiv layout, still not adapted for tiny smartphone
5. Uploads files, every type, except script based one
6. Download thems, of course
7. A tiny message system, for living note to collaborator
9. See your collaborator (Verified and anonymous)
10. Modify your account info, mail and password

What need to be imporved :

1. A better admin gestion system, more user friendly (currently Staus incrementaion in the SQL Database, need to find a way through php in front-end).
2. Secure files managing, i've disabled this function since I was having issue with Total directory flushing.
